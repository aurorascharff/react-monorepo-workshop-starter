# Real-World React — Monorepo, APIs, and Best Practice

A full-day hands-on workshop for developers building production React applications. Participants build **Medix Arena** — a clinical journal SPA — from a pre-wired starter into a fully featured application, covering the architecture decisions, tooling, and patterns that separate hobby projects from production codebases. The healthcare domain is just a teaching vehicle; every pattern is domain-agnostic and directly transferable.

Across five modules, participants work through feature-folder architecture and shared component libraries, URL-driven routing with React Router v7, minimal state with custom hooks, declarative data fetching with TanStack Query, and schema-validated forms with React Hook Form and Zod.

## Monorepo structure

```
apps/
  arena/        — React Router v7 SPA (workshop target)
  api/          — Hono REST API (pre-written, OpenAPI + Scalar docs)
  medix.com/    — Next.js marketing site (reference)
packages/
  ui/           — Shared design system (@medix/ui)
```

## Getting started

**Requirements:** Node.js v20+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aurorascharff/workshop-dips.git
cd workshop-dips
npm install
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts all apps at once via Turborepo.

| App | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Arena (SPA) | http://localhost:5173 |
| API + docs | http://localhost:3001 |
| medix.com | http://localhost:3000 |

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start all apps
npm run build         # Build all apps
npm run lint          # ESLint across all apps
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript check across all apps
npm run format        # Prettier write
npm run format:check  # Prettier check
npm run test          # Vitest across all apps
npm run db:seed       # Reset database to seed data
```

## AI

Includes nested `AGENTS.md` files (root + `apps/`, `apps/arena/`, `apps/api/`, `apps/medix.com/`, `packages/`) that scope context to each boundary. Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` before editing.

GitHub Copilot is configured via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and the [`vercel-react-best-practices`](https://skills.sh/vercel-labs/agent-skills/vercel-react-best-practices) skill is available as `/react-best-practices` in Copilot Chat.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and `build` on every push and pull request to `main`.

## Workshop materials

- [plan.md](plan.md) — day-of agenda, theory, and demos
- [tasks.md](tasks.md) — module goals and acceptance criteria

## Reading & references

If you're new to React (or coming from a strongly typed UI background like WPF/MVVM), these are the highest-leverage reads. They map directly to what we do today.
