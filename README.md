# Real World React: Monorepos, APIs, and App Structure

Most React tutorials focus on isolated components. Real applications usually have more moving parts: routes, forms, APIs, loading states, shared UI, tests, and multiple apps that need to evolve together.

In this workshop, you will work on a small React SPA inside a monorepo. We start from a working but intentionally rough codebase and improve it step by step: app structure, routing, state, data fetching, and forms.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| UI framework | [React 19](https://react.dev) + [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) |
| Routing | [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com) (SPA mode) |
| Data fetching | [TanStack Query v5](https://tanstack.com/query) |
| Forms | [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) + [Zod v4](https://zod.dev) |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com) + shadcn-style component library |
| API | [Hono](https://hono.dev) + [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) + SQLite (pre-written) |
| Monorepo | [Turborepo](https://turbo.build) + npm workspaces |
| Testing | [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) |

## Monorepo structure

```text
apps/
  arena/        - React Router v7 SPA (workshop target)
  api/          - Hono REST API (pre-written, OpenAPI + Scalar docs)
  medix.com/    - Next.js marketing site (reference)
packages/
  ui/           - Shared design system (@medix/ui)
```

## Getting started

**Requirements:** Node.js v20+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aurorascharff/react-monorepo-workshop-starter.git
cd react-monorepo-workshop-starter
npm install
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts all apps at once via Turborepo.

| App | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Arena (SPA) | http://localhost:5173 |
| API + docs | http://localhost:3001 |
| medix.com | http://localhost:3000 |

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start all apps
npm run build         # Build all apps
npm run lint          # ESLint across all apps
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript check across all apps
npm run format        # Prettier write
npm run format:check  # Prettier check
npm run test          # Vitest across all apps
npm run db:seed       # Reset database to seed data
```
